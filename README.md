# Robotstxt
 
This repository is a fork and has small enhancements over the [https://github.com/cosmaioan/robotstxt](https://github.com/cosmaioan/robotstxt) repo.

[https://github.com/cosmaioan/robotstxt](https://github.com/cosmaioan/robotstxt) is a archive of [code.google.com/p/robotstxt](code.google.com/p/robotstxt)

Added LoadFromDomain(domain) method, LoadFromDomain(domain, userAgent) overload method.

Added ProvidedDomain, FinalDomain properties. For example http://alightservices.com/robots.txt could redirect to https://www.alightservices.com/robots.txt

I hate Raw, couldn't bear seeing the word Raw changed the property name to more appropriate RobotsContent.

Based on these enahncements, RobotsContent can be cached externally for ProvidedDomain and FinalDomain.

Roadmap:

Based on necessity, few enhancements might be done.
